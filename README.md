# Reminiscence

## Event Description
White Day is a special day in Japan for the recipients of Valentinesâ€™ gifts to reciprocate back. So, in SUTD, we want to help the community forge memorable experiences together through fun activities and allow them to buy customizable gifts for their special ones. Thus, Reminiscence, the first ever Arts x Makers Clusters crossover event is then born.
